# Administrators

There are two primary parties who administrate privileged functions in Enzyme Protocol: Avantgarde Core (deployer) and the Enzyme Council (admin).

## Avantgarde Core (deployer)

As the lead developer of the protocol, Avantgarde Core deploys all contracts, and configures all of them prior to taking a release live. Once the release is taken live, full access control of protected functions is handed over to the Enzyme Council.

This procedure will be detailed in a later section.

## Enzyme Council DAO (admin)

The Enzyme Council DAO is made up of two sub-committees; the Enzyme Technical Council (ETC) and the Enzyme Exposed Businesses (EEB). The ETC is a confederation of technically skilled appointed parties who together have sole access to voting on all protected, protocol-wide functions once a release is taken live.

The Enzyme Council is a fully trusted entity, which is core to the security assumptions of the protocol.
